Project:

1. Obstacle Detector by IR sensor: (Group Project)

An obstacle detector using an IR (Infrared) sensor is a project designed to detect objects in the path of a moving entity, such as a robot or vehicle. The IR sensor emits infrared light and measures the reflection off nearby objects. When an obstacle is detected within a certain range, the sensor sends a signal to a microcontroller or other processing unit, which then takes appropriate action, such as stopping the movement or changing direction. This project is commonly used in robotics and automation systems to enhance navigation and prevent collisions. 


2. Arduino NANO, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor:(Group Project)

This project uses an Arduino Nano to control an obstacle-avoiding robot. It integrates an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor for obstacle detection, an L298N Motor Driver Module to manage 5V DC motors for movement, powered by a battery, all mounted on a chassis. The robot navigates by processing sensor data to adjust motor speed and direction, ensuring it avoids obstacles in its path effectively.
